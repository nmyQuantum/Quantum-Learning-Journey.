# Quantum-Learning-Journey.
My collection of quantum circuits, algorithms implementations (Grover, Shor), and QEC codes during my training at Quantum AI Lab.

Welcome to my personal archive of Quantum Computing exploration! This repository documents my technical growth and research activities at the **Quantum AI Lab** (Phenikaa University) as a freshman from **USTH**.

*Under training by Dr. Van-Duy Nguyen.*

## 📑 Roadmap & Contents

### 1. Fundamentals & Linear Algebra
- Implementation of basic quantum gates (H, CNOT, Pauli-X/Y/Z).
- Exercises in Statevector and Density Matrix simulations.

### 2. Quantum Algorithms
- **Grover's Search:** Implementation with 2-3 qubits.
- **Shor's Algorithm:** Understanding the period-finding logic.
- **VQE:** Simple Variational Quantum Eigensolver experiments for molecular energies.

### 3. Quantum Error Correction (Specialization) 🛡️
- Basic surface codes and bit-flip/phase-flip error correction circuits.
- Simulations of syndrome measurements.

### 4. Quantum Machine Learning (QML)
- Quantum kernels and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) basics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Frameworks:** Qiskit, PennyLane
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, IBM Quantum Lab
